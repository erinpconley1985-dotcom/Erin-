          <h2> Book Ban </h2>
          <p>Banning books does not stop the idea. It does not the action. Bans cause the banned item to take on a life of its own. People will go out of their way to find the banned item. Please stop banning books. Books have whole cultures inside of them. Whole ideas that can spark the imagination of a child into new ideas. Ideas in books can be different than anything that you could imagine. That is the beauty of it! You get to learn about something you can not even imagine! That sounds pretty great to me!</p>

    <h3>Mother Reading to Her Child</h3>
    <img src="images/book1.jpg" alt="Mom reading to child">
    <p>Can you imagine not being able to read to your child from a book you know that was good or a book you read as a child because the book was no longer available at your local library. This is now a reality because of the book bans that were created by Florida politicians like you!</p>

    <h3>Boys Reading in a Feild</h3>
    <img src="images/book3.jpg" alt="kids">
    <p>Do you see these boys reading? They look like they are enjoying themselves on a sunny day outside with a book. If that book was banned, those boys would not be enjoying themselves as much. Those boys are on an adventure of the mind because of that book. They might be learning someone about another culture or group of people that they could have imagined before. Don't Ban Books!</p>
